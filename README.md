**Project Initializer**

Everytime you want to start a project you do the basics. go to your projects folder, create a new folder for the project, do your git commands, sync the repo, add a README file and push your initial commit.

That is what this simple project is for, making your life easier, and doing all that automatically for you.

P.S.: This is only for Windows

The only things you have to do:

In the create.bat file, change the first line with the path of the directory that you want to start your new project

Change the username from Github

Move the create.bat file to C:\WINDOWS\system32

Create a secrets.py file like this:

username='your_username'
password='your_password'

Finally, type <create {name_repo}> on the Command Prompt(with vscode and python added to your PATH variables)

It should work!!!
